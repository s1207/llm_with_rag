Hardware and algorithmic knowledge cultures




Lecture Transcript:

researchers recognize the potential of GPUs learning. P this here as a computer scientists were able to demonstrate that the use of such cheap use offered inormous advantages over CPU. As certain algoriisms from our networks or answer or as learning, were more than 10 times faster. These hardwarenovations not only howarded the golden decade of the learning as Jeffen named it is these very important guy from Google. But also makes a fresh, there's a context of the desp of the extent, which models the space and has been driven by. extraordinary, you should enable with her to get examinations of this assumption from a progressed or perspective. My addresses the question of the extent to which the development of computer hardware incented development has influenced each other since invention of the computer, as the 1940s. My way of introduction, I will to send a very short freeview about computing devices before the intervention of the model, electronic digital computer. What follows is the worldwind tour through 60 years of 20th century computies. It explores how relation between Hware andment as a user of computers and science and by scientists. Hue to time constraints and against my ownian science, I will confine myself to a halfware screen and deliberately ignore questions of software manage. On my side, you can see those st stations, we will visiting. You must start with the shop. about competing devices. You for the computer. That's the beginnings of the century, mathematicians, scientists, andists and disposal arrange, as matter the meths for example, you may have been to suggest and the instruments, garages, machines, tables, with which they could calculate accept or approximimate solutions to neveratic problems that the rose that was ass scientific. It's that around 1900, there was an old zoo of the devices and masses. They trust me the classification of which to stay is a matteraphor required a very knowledgeableist of demices and methods to understand the anatomy of city devices and the physiology, terms of information processing crashes. Quite sound, but still widely using wes and methos, such as slight rules and drum meters, mechaners, multiplication oforim tables, and the user method for the American solution of organary differential equations. But they will also beise it that existed only in single copies, such as the equations here as developed in various forms. the central. What was the next street? For theatical instruments such as plimters and anegr and so forth, and you make an indpulating machines were constructed that a more life, reliable and easy that you use was a significant advance was signed to be characteriters. The first difference was that att attempts were being made to use existing large mathematical machines for scientific computer. In England, Leslie Palmly and in the United States, Wallace Eard used systematically the homage machines for cabalitionians and astronomy. here in my slide Thomas astronoming. Secondly, there were increasing attempts to build large, so called mathematical machines to solve mathematical products. For example, elected the ent a bact got started at the machine for for differential equation, the so called differential analyze. Yeah, the end of the 20th century. Almost all of the above mansion department of the tribes as tribes, said died out and then F placed by two species. The first was electronic. that in the 1940s. The second was electron 1960s That has come out to the image of the computer and insulations to the sciences. Research into the history of the inventions of has shown that the construction of a precursor machines of those in 1930s and 40s was originally initiated and driven forward percentage questions. Partially of war research. This applies both to the hour at one at the United States and the course of the Amen, as well as to the relay as. In the case of the hobmark war to be seen on the slide here, the process unformed as such. Ed, the doctor candid did in phys was working on ititation on two design, which demand is a of normalial equations. The tasks had proved it was differential. Therefore, he's a limitted the proposal for an automatic computing machine to IBM, an IBM constructive in 4 ES' machine and got it to Harard University in44. Today's second enemble integ computer. The first electronic general computer was designed by phys system,ical engineer at theor school electric engineering as liability for Pennsylvania toate reiring tables for the United States Army specialistic Research Territory that was only completed 9:45 apart was the end. In the case, it was German Zus, tens of calculation he performed as an air construction in the year,I of an automatic engineer's calculating machine. Firstly, you worked as a Freman inventor first test models, but only the contact with aeronautical research agency to seeking solutions for the calculations in what floodter Pros and war research, and the fundries support of the Reich ministry of aviation. Bals ministry allowed him to build a full automatic program control and program computing system from 945 94 There was also initially a Tosation between the first computers. so called from all. computers, which were built from the late 94wards, they were often that with specific for scientific purposes and scientists often also acted as inters. or asivid. This use a driven model of technical information was also where land instead of the concept model which wasated as well as as a politician. The best met of problems encountered is a construction of the atomic bomb, which could be solved, is the help of computing tools and machines available available at the time. He became that this is a the driving force behind the development concept of an adult from a historic program machine and of a construction of the so called IAS Put Princeton, which was used in the 1950s, for v range of sun research problems in asthematics, in the natural sciences and the engineating and as a result, it results in the transformation if may analysis, for example, and in the first operation, where the better protections. To sum up, we've seen four different ties of involvement of scientists or ingenious and the mention of it. Philos the operation of the scientists is a company, they didn't. Secondly, the scientists in the university constructing the of military clients. So be a frequency matter from founder constructing machine for always search and force the scientists who design to fundamental filaments of model computers on assumating the basis, and then there's an electronic computer It is own institute, in order to investigate a possible application of computers and soc. It does not come to 50s and 1960s, the mainrame years. Scientists are scientific institution appeared in the 1940s and 1950s and Britter in the United States and a German speaking countries as key players in computer construction. Before construction of computing was transferred to industry. From the late 1950s onwards, we just were, for the most part, no longer design. It was just. the lo's a list of my own here, which is by no means copy, but a Charles how many scientists and researchency Jews and universities were theorph, this construction, are machines. that we know for my history of much about construction of machines of man. But it's also typ difficult that we don't know the same uses issues, for example, C destruction of the curve, the Munich is unknown, very well document, so is for them, but I don't know, don't know for what's purpose it was used. And what did the doism machine? And it was a strong effort built built five cases this machine. From mid50s, universities and university researchers issues improvely entered to an I.ens is industry story. It's a planet production of your computers and eventually became more and more cist. How a high that were producer that still a relationship for the triatural relationship between the computer industries the state and science level relation to research fund, and the equ of scienceific institutional computers are used by scientists or very insist 1950s. This impression that has really a little t research. develop difference in the United States, there are a few studies on the equipment and use of computers at large national research level of the attic Energy Commission to some responsible for research and research energy. will research has made it clear to what extend military act as such as star by the influence on and research into computer. F science and the American scien system who is the long time, This clear that signific military fund of test commun technologies in the United States, we computer industry to become a global player has contributed in significantly to innovations industry. How is the significantow financious corporate computers technology and some more restraining equivity universities, and researchers, computers, computers, investor you, you need increase, in fact research, the line before the I himself, is the similar. The provisional signient institutes and universities with computers, appears to have followed different patterns in the various res beingan countries. Wh the German research foundation is the DFG played a central role in coordinating this in West Germany and the mid60s, planned the UK was additionally March more closer to a responsive ministry for this before a more corporative approach also became. Despite our un of research on the economic history of French computer companies and on the planet Tuield, which came to achieve independence from the builder industry, pictures about triular, but for France, the pictures. However, the futurization of research and the network sciences, and human economics and social sciences, is a natural science system, that's only invest in a future science today. There's also a left of factors on the different governance model of state in this process. and on the effects of different dis. studies on the large level in the United States group. And nevertheless, the scientists scientific system is a special requirements for the we might involved by our part and vice for. One way of illustrating this is the image of a double A leak consisting of the two strands of scientific product development and and vis app on the as b on the completion. computers in early 1950s. When you can use the size, the problematic mismatch between the devari sources well. What's up? The calculation of two dates from the higher of the IS computer, require, 1250 hours of computing time, while three dimensional problem would have taken 50,000 hours. Georgia. Suchings in New York capabilities are comput to technology at the time. W computer proved to be a very useful tool, the in limitations of the technology remain an obstacle to the investigation of many divers scientific questions. inter scientific how the development in the search of the computer, led to the development of so called special supercomputers whose per performance was metered as possible floating form operation the second before which joined super, as 9. The development supercomputer was initiated in 1950s in the United States by a large national research choice of the automic energy Commission of the Department of Energy. These are tys such as the Laurece, Silvermore, National Lry, and most eleos National level T, which had a noise, which had a n computing power connection with the gentle nuclear weapons. We have been key spers and customers of super computers, as social is they draw the meas choice role in the establishing of floating point as a performance between defining supercom cannot be overstated. However, say more particularly on architecture has beenated by two main factors. Firstly, that there University testified nature of the central population of tasks. Secondly, by the expansion of the computer to work computer task. Even though fast scient computers will help of the rest of Europe, might with his own worse, this is adver UK. The book G 60 in France on my, the American manufacturer CC previous research had no significant commit the International supermarket and insentities. In the 1980s, Japan succeeded the devil commented spok super eff debate in the USA about technology competition, with the system of users rebate and increasing the nationality. computers this is a factor for national security, we also proclaimed to be a fundamental instrument of cutting ad research and cuttingly necessary for the technology that weership for the United States. hand, this was a process in which had scientists, that successfully tried to mobilize the public in the American institutions. On the other hand, this was part of the general policy of the man the government hand, who is the Cold War, which corated at the intersection oft controls and this is not a Union, and the reconstruction of science in Western Europe, in the form of theependence world econony, by the United States. This is not only cremated, promoted a scientific and technologyology goes over the United States, Western Europe, but also pursued with political and ideological goals in the group. For the development of great market that see as well for the tang to the develop the supercomputers in the area characterized by the legionary designs of super train, you know slime. is a methodologically independentundency analysts is way. In, so did the stud political actions of the other Western University, and the emerging economy to analyze the effects of this context for different economic environment on the user to computing and national science and. First of all, there's a lack of studies, on the history of supercomputers and supercomputing after the error, after a fundamental reorganization of Sar for supercomusers that take place in the first half of 1990s, due to technological changes, such as the emergence of massively pessible computers, these, and. seemingly untattuted by all these changes in circumstances, and the popularity, the above mentioned to the lat about continues to sp upro over the next two seconds. The peak performs a superputers slide, which has exceeded the makeup of the in its 60s. This is stars of the computer CDC600 and the mid 1980s, with a record 32. We t in the second half90s with to us we read in massively architecture. In 2022, was the installation of the 40 years book computer as a book which national average in the United States, the ex still very,080 double transition operation, including power of 1.1 And maybe you are a little interested to see this machines, here the machines cease, 600 2, the runner, and so. These were the bing machines when they variries.. See of these because the National science systems on scientity, and technological people development, and houses changed the respective science. this, so far we' been analyzed historically historic tele very few days. E. But the other, it is completely argued as a specialist literature and in Pia Sansburg, it's supercomputers had an enormous influence on. Astronom research. Since United States was aplace in technology and alled by far largest Martin, theicient rise is that and more raisin smhes the same st which benef in the process. It should also in investigated in which specialist areas and areas is led to scientific air economic doance in Europe competition. Our knowledge is in historical t of the community used to still very limited.. has evated its use of the super survivors in central in Munich here for the on the's seen on topption that is one of the main driversersing. blue one.use of the super opinion, no over time here. for the use of Germany in the United States. This was enough, aboutages. special in the room. going attention, that's what computers received from the science andability, and the general public easily the last effect that that other heartware in the developments at a region and on signific practice from the 1960s months. of meaning so for meaning just in 1960s primary associated sitation as a PPA and the PP letter computer stand. In response to the laboratory for specialist device to want to record, there are three enters from EEC, from Ded a small journal computer and programs device and for known as EA becomes first formation. PP just 18,000. The tiny fraction of the priries of a models IBM system specs the gain frame. BDA is a p driver, speed, size, for a cost, which lets widespuction for manufacturing and small businessesign to the d worldw. Meet you just became information influence inside practices that were science wanted 70s.comut just didn't really di competition to computers, that open up completely different cultural appro computers, especially in the natural sciences century, by a lotions, a machine. It's a high flexibility, meaning computers, and evil systemaneous execution of a variety of task, making, aitor true or control, and data is a level. There are no general fields that we develop to use of mean computer latoryories. There are statistics on the computers used in all level chices of electronic energy information like same planets 75 This is Wil inside. 72 large computers with a price, $1 million, and 3 size computers. They compared with $1,531 small computers with a price than 50,000 And I was Scholine for Chinese. Stus was a gentle high energy inance of the integation of computers in field of. Also practice changed tour as a result of a change in computer technology. were used in high energy to control experiments and collette and m inventment measurement data, in in a way, the virtity, ex student human intervent. This int changed the traditional role of the physical system in that experiment. He was before these times, his experience. The first developer computer technology in 1970s and a particulars beginning use of meeting computers, he a rise to new experimental culture, which data in human warf. This is controller experiment. This process continued is the 1980s through a modified event orientated data analysis of ber data experiments, and through the use of the BD user data such as a wax, I see. It was sent an impact on the use of supercomputing lab choices in the USAI, whereverstation customs partially effect. Oh, how was that? You good.. Let's talk about. Pres especially excited the changes. trig use a meaning computers in the science practice of the sign of discipline comes from multiplear biology. In the study of research on the warm sea elegants, this is correct as a latory of the volar biology, in 1980s, you must show how the transition from modeling Wall unating program, main computer, writing a program on the more easily program and access of the main computers, fundamentally effect that the research. Initially, so that we research agenda was cacterized by an hypotheses, high processes driven research processors, and the mainream computer was used to analyze the genetic basis of the war st. With the introaction and use of meaning computers by biologists in theory that only attract of data production and data exchanges other research groups change. The research genda itself was also transformed in the direction of the data intensive research project that now aimed to map in sequence involves. The more easily programmer than interactive, it uses the min computers proved to be the historicallyally specific key techology, that only change in also of research for because the scientist in b them introduce a res research practist. this came about and talking about where's PCr. It's the first house of the is a new type of computer. It's a so called work station in Whitesp scientific engineering the Institutes, and then shows and once again, famented chains to the practice of scingities.. Worst stations and you can see some one workst on my side here, based on the Motor processor. powerful computers designed for single users characterized as a large dbit displays and the use of the mouse for input. For the younger ones, species did not always have a mouse and such as scings and the different machines in these specs. The setting apart from computers, and a much less powerful person computers with a relatively small user. Butus, my microscessic technology had me possible for stations, down the way as a few types of personal singing music computer around $20,000. This was also collectzed by the Neties could be connected to other work stations, main computers and computers, could also serve as a brander interface. My revolution with the rivetur the celling production, was that univers revolution inside computing. late 1990s, this was possible to build a high end road station that approached the cay wall, the computing space, but had a large profable price performance station. Researchers did basically uses highro stations and network work stations, clusters for a wide range of spell with sun computations. Not only was the strategy used when research teams didn't have access to work was a supermarket just crossing handlingments of dollars, but he smart processor farms took on and almost iconic status of major research level choice and large research institution, institutions in the United States and the early United United. Scientists, again, we gained more control over the research data and the scientific practice of scientific changed it. It's Jonathan, when he sees a powerful, became began to powerful processessors and high res sololution screens. The distinction between workstation and PC became more efficient of the function of the computer.. If an example, rich National in Tennessee to that a lot of Jew self supercomputer from a computerter of thiss. This was used to create a high resolution. 7,800,000 square cell lab of all the ec regions, was a safe climate landform and solid characteristics in the United States. Hence this was a sc. It is a sheep road stations and it is increasing performance of injection to capabilities species became some of instrumental atrocody. The reason that replace in manyusers as a cultural experiments in the. What's introductionation, met design experimentation, and observation, and data collection and analysis and sign of in that in so far only to a limited extent it has been the subject of little historical research. However, one inst is based on is a huge of the so called density functional series inlanted chemistry. called Johnena has to work on this, which experiences specul and p custing in this 1990s and triggered at this n transformation of quantum chemistry into computational p chemistry. The cause of that moment has an increasing possibility of use in natural first stations is then also can see as well as the set of computation of the field. And you can see this here on my side, this is a papers, and I adm argument here is this is really a hardware reason that it is possible that's the large source of hardware reason created new way of creating Let's talk B's Harper. I would want to sum up little bit I've told you during the last 10, 20 minutes, I not his time the 1970s 1990s. From the early 1970s to the NFC, 1980s to the Hway environment in the premises of universities of research institution changed. In 1970, the apart from a few mei computers such as a VPA PP8 for the PD8 brain frame computers tens computers such as a CCC 600, their primary in UA. In the second half of the 1980s, the range of half under the significant expansion. Like this computers, such as a create two, introduced in 1985 rem made at the top of the performance sture, followed by a music computers, main friends, super many computers, such as the wax, which is77, meaning, such as the 50D 11, works stations such as San Juan II, and finally, it's the bottom of the performance spectrum, he sees, such as the RBMPCAT in 1984. If You're so old, if you're born in 1960s, like me, might have experienced the performance peak from the IPC to the NPCATs because very interesting. In addition, to the computer market is a 1950s. It' by a widely various pizza in. W technological progress, many computers and mail frames or rather slow. This is that the microw focus, you start at more. started in the of iteration, New York stations of seas After the establishment of a 60 midnight processes on the first half of the 1980s, 32 microrocesses such as the Waterola 680, 2, or more known, maybe the Intel, 80 digs 386. And that's the market. It's a bit of the decade, leading to discussions in the German computer center scene as to whether such mainframes on a single silicone shell will soon even comp repeat's mainframes and re revolutionized data processing more than all the developments before. So that have computer. This is possible reflects the fact, the world 1970s to the end of the 80s, the developmention, also significantly changed researchers, accessed computers at universities and research institution. Since the 1950s, centers successively established aiversities and researcher institutions that developed into impependent organization units with their own site, staff, as well as maintenance and the bearing personnel, and the managed by a science direct. And he computer centers, called the kitchen center in, which are initially usually only equ with one main computer. Scientists will run the program the equ. computers are meaningers are station where a way users. existing in action computer user is a computer into question so much the 1980s that there's a university computer sense in West Germany, the tries. In some cases, they discussing cuts and even fosetics of institution. And there's other side that it shows that general of the centers and central beauty in the 1980s was completely different in the country when only workst the precedure invented. Fur that produced, but also raising their most widely usedits. After the sim of studies in the early 80s, which point out the working problem of the lab is in higher commer security resources in the American American system, and diagnosing technology leadership system. National initiated programources. 195, the West Congress, established the National scienceience Foundation for NS Supergirl. The NS program set in motion, the comprehensive lot better expansion, super a page research institution and univers. I the early 1990s, do more computers had super were also NSF network and does sound of researchs. This is computing centers as public started started so far with some exceptions, exceptions in our room. computer centers are always online spot... Yeah. I don't what would likely do summer There's a discussion, would have to be some remarks about history of technology in general and I need some of technology. and in conscious to things I have imprison. The ids which handed in Aust formulated in a more way where they recognize that question if youership technology. This is a very famous book, as technology for history, by Smith and the Mars, very prominent because this issue the technology as the United States Can we formulated in a slightly modified form, there's a computer drive science center technology. In Western Industrial assumption of economy society accepted. This is spare of politics, economics, and society. That's well as a amount, therefore assignientists and engineering. In contrast, since the 1970s, historians of technology, converted to a model of contextualized hist history, and have attempted to prove in studysis assumption that the technology, is an anous, is that continuous transformation of human wirement? Is 99? On the one hand, a technological deb, that can beonous shap by an individual. hand, that social change cannot beed byution. has a much of words of the social construction of the technology and idea bodies to appearce dance against technological danism and argues that in a few technologies, this is always to result of theation process of between your friend groups, hist to stand against Jews, which are held by the majority of technology, historians, in much discussed works. In 2005, computer histori Paul Shiruzzi arals as a trophy in my speaks by by Muslov in software of, is a sort of const to this view of technology to the and the pre Isra. Instead more for developers to be subject toricular analysis the next mine to see whether higher or not is that a form, technology. Three years later, this is a very famous histal physic for form preised in his proper and brill the I artic bill. It' Priacy of science and modernity of techn energy, and possible damnity, and of ideology in the history of technology. So we have really cut thehena of techn potato using by the waste majority of technology, historians, as an orthodoxy based on feds, based on on facts are on ideology. Say a exampleample I signed to the professional hist important of this meditation of the alism is another part not the update about the datingism.cept that he is about, that he is one about changes in society of the economy, about the of rather particularly interesting questions for the technology. He has the questions from science technology, relationship, transitionally discussed in the history of your technology. A turn on red head, technology is going on on the supplying at the science. science apply computer technology. to the article started. In my opinion, we' certainly too simplistic to analyze into relationship between Mark and Uer scient ever scientific ever than using trivial imp pain. O just technological data and hypic and psych. It could be to question, how it will change in that computer technology, are putting pressure on scientists or how are opening a few opportunities. And how we stable of events can be located on a scale from softwareerminism to how detism individual pieces. For example, it would be worth questioning, the hardware the networks and software will eventually give rise to the two large scaled the systems, the sense is described by the very famous is well by use, which the technological, by used to major influential discip. How you that be, and slight. The question raised cons relations between scient dead world and the technology. And only answer, if we also stay into the account that are recent device used by scientists, the program right is that we use. In other words, if we mins that I wrote with knowledge cultures computer design. is because computer is a technology differ from all other technology, you want respect, which no one has foundated as beautifully and clearly, as a historian of science might be only, friend of mine, and his dad. Well, other technologies, maybe, may be said to have a nature of their own an to exercise in agency and a sign computer is nature. Or rather than its nature's protein. The computer is certainly was at the beginning, what you make of it of it through the task we set for it in the program soon for it. Thank you. It's to you for this
